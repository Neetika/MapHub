The file" MapHub.html" contains the code for the Map Overlaying.
If the overlaid map is not seen when you try to run the code locally on your machine,do the following steps:


1. Create a Big folder where you can have sub folders of the maptilset (6 till 12) [i.e. the min and max tileset]
2. Copy all the maptileset folders (all in one place)
3. Place the MapHub.html in the big folder
4. Now try to launch the MapHub.html from here. 

If it still does not work, try to change the path locations according to your own settings, as mentioned in the code.
